An Honesty Based COVID-19 Questionare meant to be answered before entering a building 

So my work made me use a website to "check myself for COVID" and it sucked. 
It would never load, it would load one question, but not the next and then it would time out and it took me 10 mins standing there like an idiot just to answer the damn questions. Nevermind the fact I would kept spamming "NO" even if was coughing into my positive COVID Test Results. (Never tested positive, I would have stayed at home if I thought I had symptoms)

Half the time it didn't even load, so I had answer the questions to a real person. There was only one person so a bunch of people would stand in line in front of this person to answer the same fricken question. Never mind they had someone else there taking everyone's temp, s/he could have just pointed to the sign and asked "you sick brah?" and we would say "nah brah" and this entire farce would be over. But noooooo I had to use this website contracted out to drunk monkeys. 

So I decided to recreate the final screen and  just host that static website and tell the guy taking my temp that I answered the questions. He wouldn't care, I wouldn't care, win-win. 

So I downloaded the website and realized that it wasn't designed by drunk monkeys. 

Saying that this website was designed by durnk monkeys is an insult to all the drunk monkeys and their neglegant/awesome caretakers around the world. (For legal reasons: please don't feed your monkey booze)

I decided that a drunk monkey could program this website better. Unfortunatally the only monkey I know just got his 3 mo chip from Alcoholics Anonymous.(We Believe In You Bonzo!)

So I decided to become a drunk code-monkey to program this.

Here are the rules I set for myself:
1. I had to make a website that had the same functionality as their website. Minus Tracking
2. I had to be drunk while working on this. 
3. It had to be equal or "better"

I do believe I have passed rules 1 and 2, but I will need your opinion on rule 3.

I'm hosting this on 
yousickbrah.org 
to make it live. Finding hosting for the website was harder than making the website. 

The questionaire is meant to be done on mobile, so that is why it looks weird on your desktop. 

Let me know what you think. 

TL/DR: this is a drunkenly made Gripe Site that is around because I was bored during COVID.
