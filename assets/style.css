/*
    My Employer's website these buttons were pictures. Literally pictures of buttons. Seriously
    The link to the CDC's website was surrounded by these pictures and it was just there
    No "Click Me" text that was a hyperlink. Just a hyperlink.
    Looked like:
    [BUTTON]https:www.cdc.gov/otherstuff[BUTTON]
    I have no idea why they would do this. It gets worse
    I tracked back where they got the "buttons" from. It was screen shot from the CDC website
    I'm not fucking kidding
    https://web.archive.org/web/20200514233444/https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/
    They couldn't even be assed to do 10 mins of desging. It took me 1 min to find the CDC colors.
